1. Faceted Search

2. Audio Processing (use sox with CLI utility to process and categorize sound samples)

3. Database Linking

4. Page Ranking - finished-ish (call searchHits(searchStr) from tfidf.js)

5. File Upload - (garrett, you finished this right?)

6. Image Processing - I'd say this is out of the scope of this project; can write it off as a 'if we go further' in the report

7. In-Depth Search from Food

8. Improved A/C
if (document.activeElement.id === 'searchAc') {

}
